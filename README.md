# Crypto-Encryption
It is a simple encryption algorithm that creates a substitution dictionary cipher, cuts and mixes the encrypted message with the ability to write its own key to it.

> Disclaimer: I don't know much about cryptography. So I just wanted to create my own encryption algorithm for the sake of a blind experiment. So yes, it can be very inefficient and easy to crack.

Encryption algorithm:
1. Creating a seed using the user's key for the random module.
2. Creating a substitution dictionary for the cipher.
3. Encrypting the text using the dictionary.
4. Mixing the encryption code.
